*   A diagram showing arrays of lights for specific scenes and effects ([PNG](/ans7870/21m/21m.873/iap08/imagegallery/lights/lights2.png))

Student Reflection
------------------

OpenCourseWare asked various cast and crew members to contribute their reflections on the production process and result. Jonas Kubilius, actor of Tim, sent us his thoughts. Used with permission. ({{% resource_link 5e5d0f18-fd02-c359-e247-20ec8dd0a865 "TXT" %}})
